The graph depicts how rainfall and snowfall affect the temperature in the USA. After analyzing the CSV files I acquired from the websites and going over the data, I tried to plot it appropriately. I correctly plotted it with no mismatches and truncated the data.

- I used aesthetically pleasant and acceptable fonts, colors, and layout for my dataset.
- I pick a charting type that is appropriate for the dataset, such as a line or wave chart.
- I select a wave charting style that is appropriate for the dataset, completing my functionality and making it appealing to users.
- Based on information from websites, all the details are accurate and logical.
